The dynamics of spiral waves are an important field of study in systems of oscillatory media, such as heart tissue, brain waves, and chemical reactions. In this project, we look at chemical reactions, which allow us to study in more simplicity the behavior of rotating spiral waves. Our long term goal is to understand the effects of a nonlocal feedback mechanism on the dynamics of the spiral’s core. In particular, we want to show that this mechanism is correlated with a certain periodic forcing. In this context, the feedback is calculated by determining the weighted average of a chemical component contained in a circular region of the domain and calculating how this quantity changes over time. The nonlocal aspect comes from considering regions that are off center from the spiral’s core.

As a starting point we look at a weighted average that can be calculated using two concentric circles – where the innermost circle has greater feedback strength. We use the arc length of the spiral contained in these regions as an approximation for the amount of chemical inside. We use standard packages built in python to do this. Preliminary results show that the feedback mechanism can be represented as a periodic function that has the same frequency as the rotational frequency of the original spiral wave which later depicts a drift of the spiral’s core.
